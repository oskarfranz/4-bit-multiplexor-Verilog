# 4-bits-multiplexor-Verilog
This is the design of a 4 bit multiplexor (changes the destiny of the income digital signals)

# /////////////////WARNING////////////////
The design was developed to be used on a DILIGENT BASYS 3 prototyping board or any similar with an ARTIX-7 (XC7A35T) processor, attempting to run this project directly into non compatible environments may cause several problems with your device. 

Design sources by it's own should work normally in any other devices.
